			<h2>Websites</h2>
			<p>The de facto standard for sharing information is currently through a web browser. While we
classify this all as “the web” the real term is “web services,” as not everything on the web is a
website. If you check e-mail using a web browser, you are using a web service. Often times,
web services require privileges. This means you need a login name and password to gain
access. Having access and the legal right to access is known as having “privileges”. Hacking
into a website to allow you to change the page may be having access, but since it is not your
legal right to do so, it is not privileged access. We are only concerned with having privileged
access, but as your experience grows with using the web, you will find many places give
access to privileged areas by accident. As you find this, you should get into the habit of
reporting this to the website owner.
Websites are searchable through a large number of search engines. It's even possible to
make your own search engine, if you have the time and hard drive space. Often, it's the
search engines who get privileged access and pass it on to you. Sometimes it is in the form of
cache. A cache is an area of memory on the search engine's server where the search engine
stores pages that matched your search criteria. If you click on the link that says cached,
instead of the actual link, then you will see a single page that shows what the search engine
found during its search. The search engines save this information to prove that the search was
valid – if, for instance, a page goes down or is changed between the time that you initiated
your search and the time that you try to access the page that was returned – but you can
also use the cached pages for other purposes, such as bypassing a slow server.
One of the most useful public caches is at http://www.archive.org. Here you will find cached
versions of whole websites from over the years.
One final note on websites, do not assume you can trust the content of the websites you visit
just because they appear in a search engine. Many hacker attacks and viruses are spread
just by visiting a website or downloading programs to run. You can safeguard yourself by not
downloading programs from untrusted websites and by making sure the browser you use is
up-to-date on security patches.</p>

			<h2>P2P</h2>
			<p>Peer to Peer, also known as P2P, is a network inside the Internet. Instead of many local
computers communicating with each other through a centralized, remote computer, the
computers in a P2P network communicate directly with each other. Most people associate
P2P with the downloading of mp3s and pirated movies, however, many other P2P networks
exist – both for the purposes of exchanging a wide variety of information and as a means to
conduct research on distributed information sharing. One website dedicated to teaching
about this, http://infoanarchy.org, is based on the premise that information should be free.
On the Infoanarchy website, you can find a listing of available P2P networks and clients.
The problem with P2P networks is that, while you can find information on just about anything
on them, some of that information is on the network illegally. The Hacker Highschool program
doesn't condone the use of P2P to illegally download intellectual property, but there is no
question that P2P networks can be a vital resource for finding information. Remember: there
is nothing illegal about P2P networks – there are a lot of files that are available to be freely
distributed under a wide variety of licenses – but there are also a lot of files on these networks
that shouldn't be there. Don't be afraid to use P2P networks, but be aware of the dangers.</p>
